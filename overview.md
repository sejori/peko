<h1>Peko library overview</h1>



<h2 id="server">Server</h2>

The TypeScript `server.ts` module describes a small framework for building HTTP servers on top of the Deno http/server module. 

Here are the main components:

- **Server class**: which manages the HTTP server, the routes, and the middleware.
- **RequestContext class:** holds information about the server, the request, and state to be shared between middleware.

Main types (`types.ts`):

- **Route**: an object with path, method, middleware, and handler properties.
- **Middleware**: a function that receives a RequestContext and updates state or generates a response.
- **Handler**: a function that handles requests by receiving a RequestContext and generating a response.

The Server class has several methods for adding and removing routes and middleware, as well as starting the server and handling requests:

- **use(middleware: Middleware | Middleware[] | Router)**: add global middleware or a router.
- **addRoute(route: Route)**: adds a route to the server.
- **addRoutes(routes: Route[])**: adds multiple routes to the server.
- **removeRoute(route: string)**: removes a route from the server.
- **removeRoutes(routes: string[])**: removes multiple routes from the server.
- **listen(port?: number, onListen?: callback)**: starts listening to HTTP requests on the specified port.
- **close()**: stops to HTTP listener process.

```js
import * as Peko from "https://deno.land/x/peko/mod.ts"; // or "../server.ts" for super featherweight 

const server = new Peko.Server();

server.use(Peko.logger(console.log));

server.addRoute("/hello", () => new Response("Hello world!"));

server.listen(7777, () => console.log("Peko server started - let's go!"));
```

<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>

Routes can be added to a Server instance directly or a Router instance. Below you can see the different ways routes can be added with `addRoute`.

```js
import * as Peko from "https://deno.land/x/peko/mod.ts"; // or "https://deno.land/x/peko/server.ts"

const server = new Peko.Server()
server.addRoute("/hello", () => new Response("Hello world!"))
server.removeRoute("/hello");

const router = new Peko.Router()

router.addRoute("/shorthand-route", async (ctx, next) => { await next(); console.log(ctx.request.headers); }, () => new Response("Hello world!"));

router.addRoute({
    path: "/object-route",
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => { await next(); console.log(ctx.request.headers); }, // can also be array of middleware
    handler: () => new Response("Hello world!")
})

router.addRoutes([ /* array of route objects */ ])

server.use(router)

server.listen()
```

<h2 id="request-handling">Request handling</h2>

Each route must have a <code>handler</code> function that generates a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response). Upon receiving a request the `Server` will construct a [RequestContext](https://deno.land/x/peko/server.ts?s=RequestContext) and cascade it through any global middleware, then route middleware and finally the route handler. Global and route middleware are invoked in the order they are added. If a response is returned by any middleware along the chain no subsequent middleware/handler will run.

Peko comes with a library of utilities, middleware and handlers for common route use-cases, such as:
- server-side-rendering
- opening WebSockets
- JWT signing/verifying & authentication
- logging
- caching

See `handlers`, `mmiddleware` or `utils` for source, or dive into `examples` for demo implementations. 

The second argument to any middleware is the `next` fcn. This returns a promise that resolves to the first response returned by any subsequent middleware/handler. This is useful for error-handling as well as post-response operations such as logging. See the below snippet or `middleware/logger.ts` for examples.

If no matching route is found for a request an empty 404 response is sent. If an error occurs in handling a request an empty 500 response is sent. Both of these behaviours can be overwritten with the following middleware:

```js
server.use(async (_, next) => {
    const response = await next();
    if (!response) return new Response("Would you look at that? Nothing's here!", { status: 404 });
});
```

```js
server.use(async (_, next) => {
    try {
        await next();
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
        return new Response("Oh no! An error occured :(", { status: 500 });
    }
});
```

<h2 id="response-caching">Response caching</h2>

In stateless computing, memory should only be used for source code and disposable cache data. Response caching ensures that we only store data that can be regenerated or refetched. Peko provides a `ResponseCache` utility for this with configurable item lifetime. The `cacher` middleware wraps it and provides drop in handler memoization and response caching for your routes.

```js
const cache = new Peko.ResponseCache({ lifetime: 5000 });

server.addRoute("/do-stuff", Peko.cacher(cache), () => new Response(Date.now()));
```

And that's it! Check out the API docs for deeper info. Otherwise happy coding ðŸ¤“
