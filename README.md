<h2>Project goals:</h2>

- <strong>Client-edge synergy</strong> - Share modules across stack for server-rendering and simpler dev (no transpiling).

- <strong>Production-ready backend</strong> - Fully-tested library built with stable Deno APIs only + server profiling utility.

- <strong>Software minimalism</strong> - Native JavaScript APIs first, [Deno std library](https://deno.land/std) second, then custom utilities.

- <strong>Ease of adoption</strong> - Easily convert [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) or [Koa](https://github.com/expressjs/express) apps with familiar API and no enforced file structure.

Any feature suggestions or code reviews are very welcome!

<h2>Get started</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3 id="#server">Server</h3>

The TypeScript `server.ts` modules describes a small framework for building HTTP servers on top of the Deno http/server module. 

Here are the main components:

- **Server class**: which manages the HTTP server, the routes, and the middleware.
- **RequestContext class:** holds information about the server, the request, and state to be shared between middleware.

Main types (`types.ts`):

- **Route**: an object with path, method, middleware, and handler properties.
- **Middleware**: a function that receives a RequestContext and updates state or generates a response.
- **Handler**: a function that handles requests by receiving a RequestContext and generating a response.

The Server class has several methods for adding and removing routes and middleware, as well as starting the server and handling requests:

- **use(middleware: Middleware | Middleware[] | Router)**: add global middleware or a router (and its routes).
- **addRoute(route: Route)**: adds a route to the server.
- **addRoutes(routes: Route[])**: adds multiple routes to the server.
- **removeRoute(route: string)**: removes a route from the server.
- **removeRoutes(routes: string[])**: removes multiple routes from the server.
- **listen(port?: number, onListen?: callback)**: starts listening to HTTP requests on the specified port.
- **close()**: stops to HTTP listener process.

```js
import * as Peko from "https://deno.land/x/peko/mod.ts"; // or "https://deno.land/x/peko/server.ts"

const server = new Peko.Server();

server.use(Peko.logger(console.log));

server.addRoute("/hello", () => new Response("Hello world!"));

server.listen(7777, () => console.log("Peko server started - let's go!"));
```

<h3 id="#routing">Routing</h3>

Instead of adding routes to a server instance directly, a Router class instance can be used. Below you can also see the different ways routes can be added with `addRoute`.

```js
import * as Peko from "https://deno.land/x/peko/mod.ts"; // or "https://deno.land/x/peko/server.ts"

const server = new Peko.Server()

const router = new Peko.Router()

router.addRoute("/hello-log-headers", async (ctx, next) => { await next(); console.log(ctx.request.headers); }, () => new Response("Hello world!"));

router.addRoute({
    path: "/hello-object-log-headers",
    middleware: async (ctx, next) => { await next(); console.log(ctx.request.headers); }, // could also be an array of middleware
    handler: () => new Response("Hello world!")
});

router.addRoutes([ /* array of route objects */ ]);

router.removeRoute("/hello-log-headers");

server.use(router)

server.listen()
```

<h3 id="request-handling">Request handling</h3>

Each route must have a <code>handler</code> function that generates a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response). Upon receiving a request the `Server` will construct a [RequestContext](https://deno.land/x/peko/server.ts?s=RequestContext) and cascade it through any global middleware, then route middleware and finally the route handler. Global and route middleware are invoked in the order they are added. If a response is returned by any middleware along the chain no subsequent middleware/handler will run.

Peko comes with a library of utilities, middleware and handlers for common route use-cases, such as:
- server-side-rendering
- opening WebSockets
- JWT signing/verifying & authentication
- logging
- caching

See `handlers`, `mmiddleware` or `utils` for source, or dive into `examples` for demo implementations. 

The second argument to any middleware is the `next` fcn. This returns a promise that resolves to the first response returned by any subsequent middleware/handler. This is useful for error-handling as well as post-response operations such as logging. See the below snippet or `middleware/logger.ts` for examples.

If no matching route is found for a request an empty 404 response is sent. If an error occurs in handling a request an empty 500 response is sent. Both of these behaviours can be overwritten with the following middleware:

```js
server.use(async (_, next) => {
    const response = await next();
    if (!response) return new Response("Would you look at that? Nothing's here!", { status: 404 });
});
```

```js
server.use(async (_, next) => {
    try {
        await next();
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
        return new Response("Oh no! An error occured :(", { status: 500 });
    }
});
```

<h3 id="response-caching">Response caching</h3>

In stateless computing, memory should only be used for source code and disposable cache data. Response caching ensures that we only store data that can be regenerated or refetched. Peko provides a `ResponseCache` utility for this with configurable item lifetime. The `cacher` middleware wraps it and provides drop in handler memoization and response caching for your routes.

```js
const cache = new Peko.ResponseCache({ lifetime: 5000 });

server.addRoute("/do-stuff", Peko.cacher(cache), () => new Response(Date.now()));
```

And that's it! Check out the API docs for deeper info. Otherwise happy coding ü§ì

<h2 id="cool">Motivations</h2>

The modern JS edge is great because the client-server gap practically disappears. We can have all of the SEO and UX benefits of SSR without any JavaScript transpilation or bundling. We can use modules and classes in the browser until users decide they want cloud compute. If we want TS source we can [emit](https://github.com/denoland/deno_emit) JS versions of code. This completely eliminates part of the traditional JavaScript toolchain, increasing project maintainability and simplicity, all while making our software even faster.

Better yet, Peko is not build for any specific frontend framework or library. You can use barebones HTML, React, Preact, Vue... you name it (if you do set up a React or Vue project please consider opening a PR to the examples). Simply plug your app-rendering logic into the [Render](https://deno.land/x/peko@v1.0.0/handlers/ssr.ts?s=Render) function of an [ssrHandler](https://doc.deno.land/https://deno.land/x/peko/lib/handlers/ssr.ts).

This is all made possible by powerful new JavaScript tools. Deno is built to the [ECMAScript](https://tc39.es/) specification</a>. This makes it compatible with browser JavaScript which elimates the need to generate separate client and server JavaScript bundles (the support for URL imports is the secret sauce). UI libraries like [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) combined with [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) offer lightning fast client-side hydration with a browser-friendly markup syntax. On top of this Deno has native TypeScript support, a rich runtime API and loads of community tools for your back-end needs.

This project started out of excitement for the elegancy of Deno and the freedom it would bring to the JavaScript community. If you are interested in contributing please submit a PR or get in contact ^^
